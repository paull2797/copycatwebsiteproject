# Portfolio Relection

[Link to Project](https://paull2797.github.io/copycatwebsiteproject/)

In this project, we had to recreate an existing website from scratch. This project will help us learn more about Basic Web Design. We were allowed to ask others for help IRL or on Slack, however, everyone has to make a project by themselves. Functions such as User Interactions are strictly optional. Through the project timeline, I learned how there are some things that I had not learned yet and shouldn't be embarassed to search up. An example would be when I added a hover function and I looked online (w3 schools) to see how it is used.
